    <h1>Baleadas</h1>
    <img src="/images/Baleada.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baleadas are to Honduras what pupusas are to El Salvador and tacos are to Mexico. A simple baleada consists of a thick flour (though sometimes corn) tortilla that's been put on a charcoal grill. It's slathered in refried black beans, topped with a bit of white farmer's cheese, then folded over like an American-style soft taco.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups refried beans, warmed</li>
        <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco (fresh white cheese)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crema fresca (fresh cream)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the tortillas: Mix flour, water, vegetable oil, egg, and salt together in a large bowl. Knead dough until smooth and no longer sticky. Form into eight golf ball-sized balls. Cover and let rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stretch each ball of dough into a thick tortilla.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla until browned and lightly puffed, about 1 minute per side.</li>
        <li>Layer refried beans, avocado, and queso fresco onto warm tortillas, then drizzle crema over top. Fold tortillas in half to eat.</li>
    </ol>
